# Data

> A data entity is very similar to a service. You can see it as your bridge/an adapter between the server API and the client. You might not need this if your website or mobile app doesnâ€™t process content from an API.

> It is in charge of most of the network calls your app will make, get and post content, and transform payloads as needed before being sent, or stored in the store of your app (such as Redux). In most projects, the data coming from an API is used by more than one screen or component, and needs to be available from anywhere.
